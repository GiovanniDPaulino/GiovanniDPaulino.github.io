		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
		<p>My name is Giovanni Paulino. I used to go to Monroe-Woodbury High School, which is located in Central Valley, New York. My main hobby is playing video games, but I like to play the piano really de-stress. I also love reading, in particular I've started reading the Lunar Chronicles. I've always to try skydiving, it seems like fun, but I wonder where you land afterwards. Do you rent an entire field to land in? Because it seems like you wouldn't be too accurate when jumping out of a plain.</p>
